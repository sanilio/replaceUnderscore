This script replaces underscores with blank spaces
in filenames.

It takes an input directory path in the command line,
the directory and its subdirectories are scanned,
and filetypes of pdf, djvu, txt, epub, chm or mp3
can have their underscores replaced.

The user may verify the look of the filenames
before renaming them. The user may also modify
this script to include additional file types.

To use the script in Windows:

    *run the command prompt
    *type the name of the script and the desired directory

    e.g.:

        cmd >> script.py c:\ebooks
